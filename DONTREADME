Arduino R3 
MFRC522
LoRa_Reyax896
UNL2003 STEPPER INTERVAL MOTOR
2 x 9-VOLT BATTERY POWER SUPPLY

Built to withstand power outtages and provide high density surface penetration. 
The system needs two different power supplies (its a hog) with a the UNL2003 motor unit. 
As well as properly configured resistors for the Reyax pins. 

>>Set-up nodes with rfid readers, that relay live activity to the home station<<
>>From the home station, using the //program// you can add/remove keys<<
>>Both LoRa modules need to be on the same frequency, and network, with different addresses on the network<<'
>>The password function adds encryption, both LoRa need to have the password<<
>>The micro-controller buad rate must match the LoRa, same with the LoRa and the serial monitor //program//
